      "I was using this material that was kind of
      mundane. Acoustical ceiling tile is about homogenizing
      something and making it atonal. I was thinking about
      this idea of what happened to the city in terms of
      people moving away out of fear of the crime scene and
      this social situation, violence, poverty, and this whole
      flight to the suburbs. I was thinking of this whole idea
      of homogenizing. I thought about materials in reference
      to this homogenization, and the title came to me and
      just stuck in my head, "White Flight Tea Bar". That
      became the undercurrent for the piece, this element of
      homogenizing and maybe even repressing the sound, sort
      of the functioning element. I'm interested in one, it
      being, kind of mundane, and on the other hand,
      overlooked, also, as material, and trying to give that
      material a whole loaded sense of meaning."
