	"The extensive installation Amazing Grace is an accumulation of
	over 280 prams tied together with old firehoses. The worn-out
	everyday objects hint at countless people's paths through life,
	thereby expressing time and its passage as well as an individual
	happiness. Prams are not only associated with mothers and babies,
	but in the cities of the U.S. homeless people sometimes use them
	for transporting their few belongings."
