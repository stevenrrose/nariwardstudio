    Nari Ward was born in 1963 in St. Andrews, Jamaica and he
    currently lives and works in New York. Ward's dramatic sculptural
    installations are composed of systematically collected material
    from his urban neighborhood.
    
    By revealing the numerous emotions inherent within found everyday
    objects, Ward's works examine issues surrounding race, poverty,
    and consumer culture.
